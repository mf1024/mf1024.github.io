Hello, my name is Martins Frolovs and I like to build things with software and train neural nets.  

I'm passionate about AI and I spend a lot of time studying it in depth. I mostly learn by reading[working trough] books, reading papers and by building experimental projects. 

In the past I have worked on various startups and challenging projects including [AirDog](https://youtu.be/aDI3NOwm2k0) where I designed autonomous navigation modes along with other things[lots of things].

Iâ€™m currently working at [asya.ai](https://asya.ai/) where I build and train large neural nets.

I started programming when I was 15. I mostly spent my time learning algorithms, data structures and participating in programming competitions. Few years later I won Latvian olympiad in informatics and later that year received a medal at [International Olympiad in Informatics](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/1480)

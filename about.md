Hello, my name is Martins Frolovs. I'm a machine learning engineer and an AI enthusiast. 

I’m currently working with [asya.ai](https://asya.ai/) where I build, train, analyze and deploy large neural nets. 

I'm very passionate about AI and I spend a lot of time studying it in depth. I mostly learn by reading books, reading papers, building experimental projects and writing this blog. 

I have worked on various startups and challenging projects including [AirDog](https://youtu.be/aDI3NOwm2k0) where I designed and built autonomous navigation modes along with other things[lots of things].

I started programming when I was 15. I mostly spent my time learning algorithms, data structures and participating in programming competitions. Three years later I won Latvian olympiad in informatics and later that year received a medal at [International Olympiad in Informatics](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/1480) 

I’m enthusiastic about writing clean and efficient code that works :)
